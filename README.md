# volVIC

**VOLume-based Virtual Image Correlation (volVIC) library for Python**
Python library for isogeometric multipatch surface fitting of volumetric images, based on the method described in [Bichet et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2025.117729).

## 📌 Overview

`volVIC` provides tools to extract **analysis-ready multipatch B-spline surface models** from volumetric scan data (CT/µCT), handling design deviations and manufacturing defects.
Key features:
- Multi-patch B-spline surface representation.
- Deformation to match as-manufactured scans.
- Defect quantification and geometric analysis.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorian210/volVIC.git
cd volVIC
pip install .
```
