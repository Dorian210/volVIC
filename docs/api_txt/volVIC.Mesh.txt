connectivity, evaluation, field propagation, and visualization. It supports
both 2D and 3D meshes.

Attributes
----------
connectivity : MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity
    Multi-patch connectivity structure.
splines : list[BSpline]
    List of B-spline objects for each patch.
unique_ctrl_pts : np.ndarray
    Array of unique control points for the entire mesh.
ref_inds : np.ndarray
    Reference indices used for linking to submeshes.

  >>> __init__(
    self,
    splines: list[bsplyne.b_spline.BSpline],
    ctrl_pts: Union[list[numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating]], numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating]],
    connectivity: Optional[bsplyne.multi_patch_b_spline.MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity] = None,
    ref_inds: Optional[numpy.ndarray[numpy.integer]] = None
)
      Initialize a multi-patch B-spline mesh.
      
      This constructor sets up a multi-patch mesh with B-spline patches,
      control points, and optional connectivity and reference indices. The mesh
      can be initialized either with separated control points per patch or with
      a packed array of unique control points. If connectivity is not provided,
      it is inferred automatically from separated control points.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      splines : list[BSpline]
          List of `BSpline` objects for each patch.
      
      ctrl_pts : list[np.ndarray] or np.ndarray
          Control points of the mesh.
          - If a list of arrays is provided, each array corresponds to a patch
          (shape: `(dim_phys, n1, ..., nd)`).
          - If a single array is provided, it should contain either the unique
          control points or the full concatenated points for all patches.
      
      connectivity : MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity, optional
          Multi-patch connectivity object. If `None`, it is automatically inferred
          from separated control points.
      
      ref_inds : np.ndarray, optional
          Reference indices mapping control points to submeshes or external data.
          If `None`, defaults to `np.arange(nb_unique_nodes)`.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The mesh stores control points in a "unique" packed format (`self.unique_ctrl_pts`)
      internally, regardless of input format.
      - If `ctrl_pts` is a single array but does not match the number of unique nodes,
      it is automatically packed using the provided or inferred connectivity.

  >>> show(self)
      Display the mesh or the last plot screenshot.
      
      - If a screenshot from the last `PyVista` plot exists, it is displayed
      via `Matplotlib`.
      - Otherwise, prints a simple textual representation of the mesh.

  >>> save(self, filename: str)
      Serialize and save the mesh object to a file using pickle.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      filename : str
          Path to the file where the mesh will be saved.

    data: Union[numpy.ndarray, Iterable[numpy.ndarray]] = None
) -> list
      Evaluate the mesh (B-spline patches) at given parametric points.
      
      This method evaluates each B-spline patch of the mesh at the provided
      isoparametric coordinates `XI`. The evaluation can be performed on either
      the current control points of the mesh or a provided field.
      
      Internally, this method calls :meth:`BSpline.__call__` for each patch.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      XI : iterable of tuple of np.ndarray
          Isoparametric coordinates for evaluation, provided per patch.
      k : int or iterable of int/tuple, optional
          Degree of derivative to compute at each evaluation point. Can be a single
          integer applied to all patches or an iterable specifying values per patch.
          Default is 0 (function value).
      data : np.ndarray or iterable of np.ndarray, optional
          Field values to use for evaluation. If `None` (default), uses the current
          control points. Can be a single array in unique/global representation

      Returns
      -------
      list
          List of evaluation results, one per patch, in the order of `XI`.

  >>> assemble_grads(self, terms: list[numpy.ndarray], field_size: int) -> numpy.ndarray
      Assemble patch-wise gradient vectors into a global gradient vector.
      
      Each entry in `terms` corresponds to a gradient vector computed on a single
      patch. This method uses the mesh connectivity to map patch-local indices
      to global unique node indices and sums contributions from overlapping nodes.
      
      Important: Assumes that the degrees of freedom are arranged per field,
      i.e., `[x_0, ..., x_n, y_0, ..., y_n, z_0, ..., z_n]`. It does not
      work if the DOFs are interleaved as `[x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, ...]`.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      terms : list of np.ndarray
          Gradient vectors for each patch, typically computed from patch-local
          operations.
      field_size : int
          Number of degrees of freedom per mesh node (e.g., 3 for 3D displacements).
      
      Returns
      -------
      np.ndarray
          Global gradient vector of size `field_size * nb_unique_nodes`.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Uses :meth:`MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity.unique_field_indices` to map
      patch-local degrees of freedom to global indices.

  >>> assemble_hessians(
    self,
    terms: list[scipy.sparse._matrix.spmatrix],
    field_size: int
) -> scipy.sparse._matrix.spmatrix
      Assemble patch-wise Hessian matrices into a global sparse Hessian.
      
      Each matrix in `terms` corresponds to the Hessian on a single patch. This
      method maps the local patch indices to global unique node indices using the
      mesh connectivity and constructs a global COO sparse matrix by summing
      overlapping contributions.
      
      Important: Assumes that the degrees of freedom are arranged per field,
      i.e., `[x_0, ..., x_n, y_0, ..., y_n, z_0, ..., z_n]`. It does not
      work if the DOFs are interleaved as `[x_0, y_0, z_0, x_1, y_1, z_1, ...]`.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      terms : list of scipy.sparse.spmatrix
          Hessian matrices for each patch, typically in CSR or CSC format.
      field_size : int
          Number of degrees of freedom per mesh node (e.g., 3 for 3D displacements).
      
      Returns
      -------
      scipy.sparse.spmatrix
          Global sparse Hessian matrix of size `(field_size * nb_unique_nodes, field_size * nb_unique_nodes)`.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Uses :meth:`MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity.unique_field_indices` to map
      patch-local degrees of freedom to global indices.
      - The returned matrix is in COO format, suitable for further assembly or
      conversion to CSR/CSC.

  >>> extract_border(self) -> volVIC.Mesh.Mesh
      Extract the exterior boundary mesh from a multi-patch B-spline mesh.
      
      This method identifies the nodes and patches lying on the exterior of the
      mesh and constructs a new `Mesh` object representing only these boundary
      elements. The reference indices are also updated to correspond to the
      subset of unique nodes retained.
      
      Returns
      -------
      Mesh
          A new `Mesh` instance representing the exterior boundaries of the mesh.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The `ref_inds` of the returned mesh correspond to the indices of the
      original mesh's unique nodes included in the boundary.
      - The global layout of degrees of freedom remains the same as the parent
      mesh.

  >>> subset(self, patchs_to_keep: numpy.ndarray[numpy.integer]) -> volVIC.Mesh.Mesh
      Create a submesh containing only the specified patches.
      
      The method constructs a new `Mesh` object consisting of the patches
      indexed by `patchs_to_keep`. The unique control points and reference
      indices are reduced accordingly to match the retained patches.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      patchs_to_keep : np.ndarray of int
          Array of patch indices to retain in the submesh.
      
      Returns
      -------
      Mesh
          A new `Mesh` instance containing only the specified patches and the
          associated control points.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The `ref_inds` of the returned submesh correspond to the subset of the
      original mesh's reference indices included in the retained patches.
      - The global layout of degrees of freedom is preserved.
      - Useful for operations on a specific region or cell of a larger multipatch
      mesh.

  >>> propagate_field(
    self,
    field_values: numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating],
    indices: numpy.ndarray[numpy.integer],
    disable_parallel: bool = False
) -> numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating]
      Propagate a field defined on a subset of nodes to the entire mesh using IDW.
      
      This method uses inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to estimate
      the values of a field at unknown nodes from known nodes. The known nodes are
      specified by `indices` and the field values at those nodes are provided
      through `field_values`.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      field_values : np.ndarray of float
          Field values at known nodes, shape `(dof, n_known)` or `(n_known,)`.
          Must be of `float` type for IDW interpolation.
      indices : np.ndarray of int
          Indices of the known nodes in `self.unique_ctrl_pts`.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel computation in the IDW interpolation. Default is `False`.
      
      Returns
      -------
      np.ndarray of float
          Field values propagated to all nodes of the mesh, same dtype as input.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - `self.unique_ctrl_pts` must be float type for IDW to work correctly.
      - Interpolation is performed only for nodes not in `indices`; known node values are preserved.

  >>> propagate_field_from_submesh(
    self,
    submesh: volVIC.Mesh.Mesh,
    field_values: numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating],
    disable_parallel: bool = False
) -> numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating]
      Propagate a field from a submesh to the full mesh using IDW interpolation.
      
      This method first identifies the nodes in the submesh that correspond to the
      full mesh, then propagates the field to all nodes of the full mesh using
      inverse distance weighting (IDW). The values at known nodes are preserved.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      submesh : Mesh
          Submesh containing the nodes where the field is defined.
      field_values : np.ndarray of float
          Field values defined on the submesh nodes. Must be of `float` type for IDW.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel computation in the IDW interpolation. Default is `False`.
      
      Returns
      -------
      np.ndarray of float
          Field values propagated to all nodes of the full mesh.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Both `field_values` and `self.unique_ctrl_pts` must be of float type.
      - Interpolation is done only for nodes not in the submesh; known node values are preserved.

  >>> get_orientation_field(
    self,
    n_eval_per_elem: int = 5,
    XI_list: Optional[Iterable[tuple[numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating], ...]]] = None,
    verbose: bool = True,
    disable_parallel: bool = False
) -> list[numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating]]
      Compute the orientation field of a 3D multipatch B-spline mesh.
      
      The orientation field is calculated as the scalar triple product of the
      local tangent vectors of each element. It indicates the local handedness
      of the mesh elements (positive for right-handed orientation, negative for left-handed).
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      n_eval_per_elem : int, optional
          Number of evaluation points per element along each parametric direction.
          Default is `5`.
      XI_list : iterable of tuple of np.ndarray, optional
          Predefined parametric coordinates for each patch. If `None`, a regular grid
          is generated using `n_eval_per_elem`.
      verbose : bool, optional
          If `True`, prints progress messages. Default is `True`.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel computation. Default is `False`.
      
      Returns
      -------
      list of np.ndarray of float
          A `list` (one entry per patch) containing the orientation scalar field
          for at each evaluation point.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Only implemented for 3D meshes (`self.connectivity.npa == 3`).
      - Uses parallel evaluation via `parallel_blocks`.

  >>> correct_orientation(
    self,
    separated_fields: list = [],
    axis: int = 2,
    verbose: bool = True,
    disable_parallel: bool = False
)
      Ensure consistent orientation of all patches in a 3D multipatch B-spline mesh.
      
      This method detects and corrects inverted patch orientations by evaluating
      the integrated orientation field over each patch. Patches with a negative
      signed orientation are flipped along the specified parametric axis.
      
      The orientation of each patch is assessed by integrating the scalar triple
      product of the parametric tangent vectors using Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
      A negative integral indicates an inverted (left-handed) parametrization.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      separated_fields : list, optional
          List of fields defined in separated (per-patch) representation that must
          be flipped consistently with the control points. Each entry is modified
          before returning it. Default is an empty list.
      axis : int, optional
          Parametric axis along which inverted patches are flipped
          (`0 -> xi`, `1 -> eta`, `2 -> zeta`). Default is `2`.
      verbose : bool, optional
          If `True`, prints diagnostic information, including the number of flipped
          patches. Default is `True`.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel computation. Default is `False`.
      
      Returns
      -------
      list
          Flipped version, consistently with the control points, of `separated_fields`.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Only applicable to 3D meshes (`self.connectivity.npa == 3`).
      - Patch orientation is determined by integrating the orientation field
        returned by :meth:`get_orientation_field`.
      - Flipping a patch involves:
          * Reversing the knot vector of the selected parametric axis.
          * Reversing the corresponding axis of the separated control points.
          * Reversing the same axis for all fields listed in `separated_fields`.
      - The mesh connectivity (`unique_nodes_inds`) and `unique_ctrl_pts` are
        modified to reflect the updated orientation.
      - This operation modifies the mesh in place.

  >>> plot_orientation(
    self,
    n_eval_per_elem: Union[int, Iterable[int]] = 5,
    XI_list: Optional[Iterable[tuple[numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating], ...]]] = None,
    verbose: bool = True,
    disable_parallel: bool = False,
    **kwargs
) -> pyvista.plotting.plotter.Plotter
      Visualize the orientation (handedness) of the mesh elements.
      
      This method computes the orientation field of the mesh and visualizes it
      as a boolean field indicating whether each evaluation point corresponds
      to a right-handed (`True`) or left-handed (`False`) parametrization.
      
      Internally, the orientation field is evaluated using
      :meth:`get_orientation_field`, then thresholded as
      `orientation > 0` and reshaped to comply with plotting requirements.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      n_eval_per_elem : int or iterable of int, optional
          Number of evaluation points per element along each parametric direction.
          If an iterable is provided, it must match the parametric dimension.
          Default is `5`.
      XI_list : iterable of tuple of ndarray, optional
          Parametric coordinates at which the orientation field is evaluated,
          one entry per patch. If `None` (default), a uniform sampling is used
          for each patch.
      verbose : bool, optional
          If `True`, displays progress information. Default is `True`.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel computation. Default is `False`.
      **kwargs : dict, optional
          Additional keyword arguments forwarded to :meth:`Mesh.plot`, such as
          `cmap`, `scalar_bar_args`, `show_scalar_bar`, etc.
      
      Returns
      -------
      pv.Plotter
          The PyVista plotter object used for visualization.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The orientation field is visualized as a boolean scalar field, where
        `True` indicates a right-handed parametrization and `False` a
        left-handed one.
      - The default colormap uses red for left-handed and green for right-handed
        orientations.
      - This method is intended as a diagnostic tool, typically used before or
        after calling :meth:`correct_orientation`.

      pv.Plotter
          The `PyVista` plotter used for rendering.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - Exactly one of `unique_field` or `separated_field` may be provided.
      - Fields passed as NumPy arrays for plotting must have the same number of
        dimensions (`ndim`) as the control points array. Scalar fields must therefore
        include a leading dimension of size 1.
      - Fields are evaluated on-the-fly at visualization points, not at control points.
      - If executed in a Jupyter notebook, a screenshot of the last plot is stored
        for display via `_repr_png_`.

) -> tuple[numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating], numpy.ndarray[numpy.floating], float]
      Compute and apply a rigid body transformation aligning the mesh to a target mesh.
      
      This method computes the rigid body transformation (rotation and translation)
      that best aligns the current mesh to a target mesh using an Iterative Closest
      Point (ICP) algorithm. The transformation is then directly applied to the
      control points of the mesh.

          Number of evaluation points per element for each parametric dimension.
          If an integer is provided, the same value is used for all dimensions.
          If an iterable is provided, each value corresponds to one parametric
          direction. Default is `5`.
      XI_list : iterable of tuple of ndarray, optional
          Parametric coordinates at which the geometry is evaluated to generate
          the source surface mesh. If provided, this overrides `n_eval_per_elem`.
      plot_after : bool, optional
          If `True`, displays a visualization of the aligned source mesh and
          the target mesh after the ICP procedure. Default is `True`.
      disable_parallel : bool, optional
          If `True`, disables parallel evaluation. Default is `False`.
      
      Returns
      -------
      Rmat : np.ndarray of float, shape (3, 3)
          Rotation matrix of the rigid body transformation.
      tvec : np.ndarray of float, shape (3,)
          Translation vector of the rigid body transformation.

          Maximum absolute distance between the aligned source mesh and the
          target mesh after transformation.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - For 3D meshes, the ICP is performed on the extracted boundary surface.
      - The transformation is applied as `Rmat @ x + tvec`.
      - This method modifies the mesh in place by updating `self.unique_ctrl_pts`.

) -> meshio._mesh.Mesh
      Compute the signed distance field to a target mesh.
      
      This method evaluates the geometry of the mesh (or its boundary in 3D)
      and computes the implicit distance to the surface of a target mesh.
      The resulting distance field is returned as a `MeshIO` mesh.

      Save the mesh geometry and associated fields as ParaView-compatible files.
      
      This method is a convenience wrapper around
      `MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity.save_paraview`.
      It evaluates the multipatch B-spline geometry represented by the current
      mesh and exports several VTU files suitable for visualization in ParaView,
      with an optional PVD file for grouping time steps and mesh components.
      
      The following visualization meshes are generated:
      - Interior mesh representing the evaluated B-spline geometry

CLASS: MeshLattice
-------------------
Structured lattice mesh with an explicit reference B-spline cell.

This class represents a *fully instantiated* multipatch B-spline mesh that
exhibits a regular lattice structure obtained by repeating a reference cell
along three directions. The lattice structure is described by the repetition
counts `(l, m, n)`.

The control points and connectivity describe the *entire lattice geometry*,
exactly as in a standard :class:`Mesh`. In contrast, the `BSpline` instances
correspond to a single reference cell and are reused for all lattice cells.

`MeshLattice` therefore behaves as a standard :class:`Mesh`, while additionally
storing lattice metadata and providing utilities to extract or operate on the
reference cell only.

This is a utility class, notably used to allow
:func:`VirtualImageCorrelationEnergyElem.make_image_energies` and
:func:`membrane_stiffness.make_membrane_stifness` to assemble
operators on a single cell while exploiting lattice periodicity at the algebraic
level.

Attributes
----------
l : int
    Number of repetitions of the reference cell along the first lattice
    direction.
m : int
    Number of repetitions of the reference cell along the second lattice
    direction.
n : int
    Number of repetitions of the reference cell along the third lattice
    direction.

Notes
-----
- The lattice geometry is assumed to be fully defined at construction time.
- No geometric replication is performed internally.
- All lattice cells share identical B-spline definitions.
- The total number of patches is `l * m * n * nb_patchs_cell`.

  >>> __init__(
    self,
    l: int,
    m: int,

)
      Initialize a lattice mesh from a reference B-spline cell.
      See :meth:`Mesh.__init__` for more details.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      l : int
          Number of repetitions along the first lattice direction.
      m : int
          Number of repetitions along the second lattice direction.

          Control points of the full lattice structure, in separated or unique
          representation.
      connectivity : MultiPatchBSplineConnectivity or None, optional
          Connectivity describing the multipatch topology of the full lattice
          structure. If `None` (default), it is inferred automatically.
      ref_inds : np.ndarray of int or None, optional
          Optional reference indices associated with the control points.

  >>> from_mesh(
    cls,
    mesh: volVIC.Mesh.Mesh,
    l: int,
    m: int,
    n: int
) -> volVIC.Mesh.MeshLattice
      Construct a lattice mesh from an existing mesh.
      
      This method interprets the input `mesh` as a lattice composed of
      `l * m * n` identical cells and reconstructs a :class:`MeshLattice`
      instance using the corresponding reference cell splines.
      
      Parameters
      ----------
      mesh : Mesh
          Existing mesh representing a lattice geometry.
      l : int
          Number of repetitions along the first lattice direction.
      m : int
          Number of repetitions along the second lattice direction.
      n : int
          Number of repetitions along the third lattice direction.
      
      Returns
      -------
      MeshLattice
          A lattice mesh sharing the control points, connectivity and
          reference indices of `mesh`.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The reference cell is inferred from the first
        `mesh.connectivity.nb_patchs // (l * m * n)` patches.
      - No geometry or connectivity modification is performed; the operation
        is purely structural.

  >>> get_mesh_cell_one(self) -> volVIC.Mesh.Mesh
      Extract the reference cell mesh corresponding to a single lattice cell.
      
      This method returns a :class:`Mesh` representing one reference cell of
      the lattice, including:
      - the corresponding subset of splines,
      - the associated control points,
      - a reduced connectivity.
      
      Returns
      -------
      Mesh
          Mesh corresponding to a single lattice cell.
      
      Notes
      -----
      - The returned mesh is independent from the lattice structure but
        shares the same control point values.
      - This is typically used for analysis or visualization of the unit cell.

  >>> get_nb_patchs_cell(self) -> int
      Return the number of patches in a single lattice cell.
      
      Returns
